# Q2-Cual-ID

---

### TO DO LIST

1. Implement semantic types for both the short and long ID (file?) formats

> This will allow me to convert between the two types using an action like cual transform
> also using one type in and out of an action like cual clean

2. define possible inputs to the actions (mostly done)

> Finish defining inputs and their descriptions for the common actions and methods in the plugin

3. Define some formats

> Define a way to store the ID information which should only need one universal encoding method
> Finish up defining directory formats
> What ways can we store the same info(this could swing me away from needing to define semantic types)

*Get Evan's opinion on the last point*

4. Define actions(traverse code from notebooks to scripts)

> After defining some actual actions in scripts, write tests
> clean up bugs and documentation after finished

5. Review with Evan and hopefully push into early testing online and start work on sphynx documentation.
